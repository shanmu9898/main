== Introduction

TeachConnect (TC) is created to assist teachers and other educational professionals in *managing their contacts, appointments and tasks*. TeachConnect is also tailored for teachers who would *prefer to use a Desktop App for managing contacts*. Most importantly, it is *optimized for those who prefer to enter input using keyboard* while still having the benefits of seeing the results on a screen. If you can type fast, TeachConnect will manage your contacts faster than traditional contact books.


== About this guide

TC has many features at your disposal. This guide will help you learn and use the
various features available to utilise TC to its fullest potential. +
Don’t worry if you are not a computer geek, we will walk you through the simple steps to
become a TC master user! +
Let’s jump to <<Quick Start>> to get started. Enjoy!

== Quick Start

There a few pre-requisites that you might need to install. This shouldn't take more than a few minutes. If you already have them installed, please move to <<Features>> to learn more about our features:

.  Ensure you have Java version `1.8.0_60` or later installed in your computer.
+
[NOTE]
This app will not work with earlier versions of Java 8. +
You can download the latest Java version link:https://java.com/en/download/[here].
+
.  Download the latest `Teachconnect.jar` link:{repoURL}/releases[here].
.  Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the home folder for your TeachConnect.
.  Double-click the file to start the app. The application screen should appear in a few seconds. For details of each component of the application, you can refer to <<UserInterface>>. `Figure 1` displays an example of the screen on loading the application.
+

+
.  Type the command in the command box and press kbd:[Enter] to execute it. +
e.g. typing *`help`* and pressing kbd:[Enter] will open the help window.

.  Some example commands you can try:


* *`list`* : lists all contacts.
* **`add`**`n/John Doe p/98765432 e/johnd@example.com a/John street, block 123, #01-01` : adds a contact named `John Doe`.
* **`delete`**`3` : deletes the 3rd contact shown in the current list.
* *`exit`* : exits the app.


.  Refer to <<Features>> for details of each command.


[[UserInterface]]
== User Interface
TeachConnect application screen consists of 5 major components: menu bar, command box, command result box, active list, and calendar view. `Figure 2` annotates the position of each component in the application screen.


image::GUIcomponents.jpg[width="800"]
    Figure 2: Position of various components

* Menu bar: +
Contains two options `File` and `Help`. `File` creates a drop down menu to exit the application. `Help` opens the help window if needed.

* Command box: +
Is where users key in command input.

* Command result box: +
Shows result message upon execution of any input entered.

* Active List: +
Displays the full list of `contacts`, `students`, `appointments`, `tasks`, `classes` or `shortcuts` stored by TeachConnect. The active item list is selected by the last `list` command entered. The default list selected upon successful start up of TeachConnect is `contacts`. You can refer to <<List>> for more details. +
Item in the list is shown as a card with an index which can be used for `delete` or `edit` commands, together with their details. `Figure 3` shows the components of a typical card in the contacts list. A student marker on the top right corner of the card is used to distinguish students from other people.

Format: `export classes n/NAME p/PATH te/TYPE`

****
* Here TYPE refers to the kind of export you want to do.

[TIP]
You can export all the people at once, all the people with a certain tag at once, all the people with a certain tag in a range at once or all the people in a range with any tags in a single command. +
You can also choose to export it in Csv format which you can later open in Excel. +
You can also choose to export all the classes and the students in it using the export class format.

[WARNING]
You can only export all or people based on one or zero tags. +
Be careful about the parameter value for the format type. It has to exactly be either `xml` or `excel`.
