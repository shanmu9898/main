== Introduction

TeachConnect (TC) is created to assist teachers and other educational professionals in *managing their contacts, appointments and tasks*. TeachConnect is also tailored for teachers who would *prefer to use a Desktop App for managing contacts*. Most importantly, it is *optimized for those who prefer to work with a Command Line Interface* (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). If you can type fast, TeachConnect will manage your contacts faster than traditional GUI apps. Interested? Jump to <<Quick Start>> to get started. Enjoy!

== Quick Start

.  Ensure you have Java version `1.8.0_60` or later installed in your Computer.

.  Download the latest `Teachconnect.jar` link:{repoURL}/releases[here].
.  Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the home folder for your TeachConnect.
.  Double-click the file to start the app. The GUI should appear in a few seconds.
