== Portfolio Purpose
This portfolio was made to document all contribution I have made to the project. +
The content includes are:

. The external behavior of my contributions
. The justification for their implementation
. Details of the implementation

=== Enhancement Added: Addition of Student and Class

==== External behavior

---

include::../UserGuide.adoc[tag=class]

---

==== Justification

---
The feature of adding students as a seperate type of contact allows teachers to manage their student contacts seperately from their 
personal contacts. The class feature furhter allows teachers to group their students into groups based on the classes they are teaching.
This helps teachers to view their student contacts in a more organized manner and also keep track on what and when they have taught a 
student.

==== Implementation

---

include::../DeveloperGuide.adoc[tag=studentmanagement]

---

=== Enhancement Proposed (for Version 2.0)
* Another add command to enter students into a already existing group. 
* A grading feature to allow teachers to store a student's grades as well.
* A relations feature to 'relate' two contacts (student or not) together. A way to store any two contacts' relationship.

=== Other contributions

** Modifications to delete function to delete from the current list displayed rather then a seperate delete command for every new feature.
** Project issues assignment and management
** Project PR review
** Bugs fixes for various issues raised by other teammates and testers
