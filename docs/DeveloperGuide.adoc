By: `Team W14-B1`      Since: `Jan 2018`      Licence: `MIT`

== Introduction
Welcome to Teach Connect (TC)! TC is a command-line application which provides a convenient way for teachers and other educational professionals to better manage their contacts and schedules. This developer guide provides information that helps you to get started as a TC contributor, and aids you even if you are an experienced contributor.

The developer guide consists of the following sections:

* Setting up
* Design
* Implementation
* Documentation
* Testing
* Dev Ops
* Appendices

== Setting up

=== Prerequisites

. *JDK `1.8.0_60`* or later
+
[NOTE]
Having any Java 8 version is not enough. +
This app will not work with earlier versions of Java 8.
+

. *IntelliJ* IDE
+
[NOTE]
IntelliJ by default has Gradle and JavaFx plugins installed. +
Do not disable them. If you have disabled them, go to `File` > `Settings` > `Plugins` to re-enable them.


=== Setting up the project in your computer

. Fork this repo, and clone the fork to your computer
. Open IntelliJ (if you are not in the welcome screen, click `File` > `Close Project` to close the existing project dialog first)
. Set up the correct JDK version for Gradle
.. Click `Configure` > `Project Defaults` > `Project Structure`
.. Click `New...` and find the directory of the JDK
. Click `Import Project`
. Locate the `build.gradle` file and select it. Click `OK`
. Click `Open as Project`
. Click `OK` to accept the default settings
. Open a console and run the command `gradlew processResources` (Mac/Linux: `./gradlew processResources`). It should finish with the `BUILD SUCCESSFUL` message. +
This will generate all resources required by the application and tests.

=== Verifying the setup

. Run the `seedu.address.MainApp` and try a few commands
. <<Testing,Run the tests>> to ensure they all pass.

=== Configurations to do before writing code

==== Configuring the coding style

This project follows https://github.com/oss-generic/process/blob/master/docs/CodingStandards.adoc[oss-generic coding standards]. IntelliJ's default style is mostly compliant with ours but it uses a different import order from ours. To rectify,

. Go to `File` > `Settings...` (Windows/Linux), or `IntelliJ IDEA` > `Preferences...` (macOS)
. Select `Editor` > `Code Style` > `Java`
. Click on the `Imports` tab to set the order

* For `Class count to use import with '\*'` and `Names count to use static import with '*'`: Set to `999` to prevent IntelliJ from contracting the import statements
* For `Import Layout`: The order is `import static all other imports`, `import java.\*`, `import javax.*`, `import org.\*`, `import com.*`, `import all other imports`. Add a `<blank line>` between each `import`

Optionally, you can follow the <<UsingCheckstyle#, UsingCheckstyle.adoc>> document to configure Intellij to check style-compliance as you write code.

==== Setting up CI

Set up Travis to perform Continuous Integration (CI) for your fork. See <<UsingTravis#, UsingTravis.adoc>> to learn how to set it up.

After setting up Travis, you can optionally set up coverage reporting for your team fork (see <<UsingCoveralls#, UsingCoveralls.adoc>>).

[NOTE]
Coverage reporting could be useful for a team repository that hosts the final version but it is not that useful for your personal fork.

Optionally, you can set up AppVeyor as a second CI (see <<UsingAppVeyor#, UsingAppVeyor.adoc>>).

[NOTE]
Having both Travis and AppVeyor ensures your App works on both Unix-based platforms and Windows-based platforms (Travis is Unix-based and AppVeyor is Windows-based)

==== Getting started with coding

When you are ready to start coding,

1. Get some sense of the overall design by reading <<Design-Architecture>>.
2. Take a look at <<GetStartedProgramming>>.

== Design

This section discusses the design of TeachConnect's major components.

[[Design-Architecture]]
=== Architecture

image::Architecture.png[width="600"]
    Figure 1: Architecture Diagram

`Figure 1` given above explains the high-level design of the App. Given below is a quick overview of each component.

[TIP]
The `.pptx` files used to create diagrams in this document can be found in the link:{repoURL}/docs/diagrams/[diagrams] folder. To update a diagram, modify the diagram in the pptx file, select the objects of the diagram, and choose `Save as picture`.

`Main` has only one class called link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java[`MainApp`]. It is responsible for,

* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup method where necessary.

<<Design-Commons,*`Commons`*>> represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components. Two of those classes play important roles at the architecture level.

* `EventsCenter` : This class (written using https://github.com/google/guava/wiki/EventBusExplained[Google's Event Bus library]) is used by components to communicate with other components using events (i.e. a form of _Event Driven_ design)
* `LogsCenter` : Used by many classes to write log messages to the App's log file.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

* <<Design-Ui,*`UI`*>>: The UI of the App.
* <<Design-Logic,*`Logic`*>>: The command executor.
* <<Design-Model,*`Model`*>>: Holds the data of the App in-memory.
* <<Design-Storage,*`Storage`*>>: Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

Each of the four components

* Defines its _API_ in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* Exposes its functionality using a `{Component Name}Manager` class.

For example, the `Logic` component (refer to `Figure 2`) defines it's API in the `Logic.java` interface and exposes its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class.


image::LogicClassDiagram.png[width="800"]
    Figure 2: Class Diagram of the Logic Component

[discrete]
==== Events-Driven nature of the design

`Figure 3` shows how the components interact for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.


image::SDforDeletePerson.png[width="800"]
    Figure 3: Component interactions for `delete 1` command (part 1)

[NOTE]
Note how the `Model` simply raises a `AddressBookChangedEvent` when the TeachConnect data are changed, instead of asking the `Storage` to save the updates to the hard disk.

`Figure 4` shows how the `EventsCenter` reacts to that event, which eventually results in the updates being saved to the hard disk and the status bar of the UI being updated to reflect the 'Last Updated' time.

image::SDforDeletePersonEventHandling.png[width="800"]
    Figure 4: Component interactions for `delete 1` command (part 2)

[NOTE]
Note how the event is propagated through the `EventsCenter` to the `Storage` and `UI` without `Model` having to be coupled to either of them. This is an example of how this Event Driven approach helps us reduce direct coupling between components.

The sections below give more details of each component.

[[Design-Ui]]
=== UI component
The structure of the UI component is shown in `Figure 5`.

image::UiClassDiagram.png[width="800"]
    Figure 5: Structure of the UI Component

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java[`Ui.java`]

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `PersonListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter`, `BrowserPanel` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class.

The `UI` component uses JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java[`MainWindow`] is specified in link:{repoURL}/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml[`MainWindow.fxml`]

The `UI` component,

* Executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* Binds itself to some data in the `Model` so that the UI can auto-update when data in the `Model` change.
* Responds to events raised from various parts of the App and updates the UI accordingly.

[[Design-Logic]]
=== Logic component
The structure of the logic component is shown in `Figure 6`. `Figure 7` shows finer details concerning `XYZCommand` and `Command` in `Figure 6`.

[[fig-LogicClassDiagram]]
image::LogicClassDiagram.png[width="800"]
    Figure 6: Structure of the Logic Component


image::LogicCommandClassDiagram.png[width="800"]
    Figure 7: Structure of Commands in the Logic Component

*API* :
link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java[`Logic.java`]

.  `Logic` uses the `AddressBookParser` class to parse the user command.
.  This results in a `Command` object which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
.  The command execution can affect the `Model` (e.g. adding a person) and/or raise events.
.  The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is passed back to the `Ui`.

`Figure 8` is the Sequence Diagram for interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("delete 1")` API call.

image::DeletePersonSdForLogic.png[width="800"]
    Figure 8: Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command

[[Design-Model]]
=== Model component
The structure of the Model component is shown in `Figure 9`.

image::ModelClassDiagram.png[width="800"]
    Figure 9: Structure of the Model Component

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java[`Model.java`]

The `Model`,

* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user's preferences.
* stores TeachConnect data.
* exposes an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Person>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* does not depend on any of the other three components.

[[Design-Storage]]
=== Storage component
The structure of the Storage component is shown in `Figure 10`.

image::StorageClassDiagram.png[width="800"]
    Figure 10: Structure of the Storage Component

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java[`Storage.java`]

The `Storage` component,

* can save `UserPref` objects in json format and read it back.
* can save TeachConnect data in xml format and read it back.

[[Design-Commons]]
=== Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.addressbook.commons` package.

== Implementation

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

// tag::undoredo[]
=== Undo/Redo feature
==== Current Implementation

The undo/redo mechanism is facilitated by an `UndoRedoStack`, which resides inside `LogicManager`. It supports undoing and redoing of commands that modifies the state of TeachConnect (e.g. `add`, `edit`). Such commands will inherit from `UndoableCommand`.

`UndoRedoStack` only deals with `UndoableCommands`. Commands that cannot be undone will inherit from `Command` instead. `Figure 11` shows the inheritance diagram for commands:

image::LogicCommandClassDiagram.png[width="800"]
    Figure 11: Logic Command Class Diagram

As you can see from `Figure 11`, `UndoableCommand` adds an extra layer between the abstract `Command` class and concrete commands that can be undone, such as the `DeleteCommand`. Note that extra tasks need to be done when executing a command in an _undoable_ way, such as saving the state of TeachConnect before execution. `UndoableCommand` contains the high-level algorithm for those extra tasks while the child classes implements the details of how to execute the specific command. Note that this technique of putting the high-level algorithm in the parent class and lower-level steps of the algorithm in child classes is also known as the https://www.tutorialspoint.com/design_pattern/template_pattern.htm[template pattern].

Commands that are not undoable are implemented this way:
[source,java]
----
public class ListCommand extends Command {
    @Override
    public CommandResult execute() {
        // ... list logic ...
    }
}
----

With the extra layer, the commands that are undoable are implemented this way:
[source,java]
----
public abstract class UndoableCommand extends Command {
    @Override
    public CommandResult execute() {
        // ... undo logic ...

        executeUndoableCommand();
    }
}

public class DeleteCommand extends UndoableCommand {
    @Override
    public CommandResult executeUndoableCommand() {
        // ... delete logic ...
    }
}
----

Suppose that the user has just launched the application. The `UndoRedoStack` will be empty at the beginning.

The user executes a new `UndoableCommand`, `delete 5`, to delete the 5th person in TeachConnect. The current state of TeachConnect is saved before the `delete 5` command executes. The `delete 5` command will then be pushed onto the `undoStack` (the current state is saved together with the command).

image::UndoRedoStartingStackDiagram.png[width="800"]
    Figure 12: Undo Redo Starting Stack Diagram

As the user continues to use the program, more commands are added into the `undoStack`. For example, the user may execute `add n/David ...` to add a new person.

image::UndoRedoNewCommand1StackDiagram.png[width="800"]
    Figure 13: Undo Redo New Command Stack Diagram

[NOTE]
If a command fails its execution, it will not be pushed to the `UndoRedoStack` at all.

The user now decides that adding the person was a mistake, and decides to undo that action using `undo`.

We will pop the most recent command out of the `undoStack` and push it back to the `redoStack`. We will restore TeachConnect to the state before the `add` command executed.

image::UndoRedoExecuteUndoStackDiagram.png[width="800"]
    Figure 14: Undo Redo Execute Undo Stack Diagram

[NOTE]
If the `undoStack` is empty, then there are no other commands left to be undone, and an `Exception` will be thrown when popping the `undoStack`.

The following sequence diagram shows how the undo operation works:

image::UndoRedoSequenceDiagram.png[width="800"]
    Figure 15: Undo Redo Sequence Diagram

The redo does the exact opposite (pops from `redoStack`, push to `undoStack`, and restores TeachConnect to the state after the command is executed).

[NOTE]
If the `redoStack` is empty, then there are no other commands left to be redone, and an `Exception` will be thrown when popping the `redoStack`.

The user now decides to execute a new command, `clear`. As before, `clear` will be pushed into the `undoStack`. This time the `redoStack` is no longer empty. It will be purged as it no longer make sense to redo the `add n/David` command (this is the behavior that most modern desktop applications follow).

image::UndoRedoNewCommand2StackDiagram.png[width="800"]
    Figure 16: Undo Redo New Command 2 Stack Diagram

Commands that are not undoable are not added into the `undoStack`. For example, `list`, which inherits from `Command` rather than `UndoableCommand`, will not be added after execution:

image::UndoRedoNewCommand3StackDiagram.png[width="800"]
    Figure 17: Undo Redo New Command 3 Stack Diagram

The following activity diagram summarize what happens inside the `UndoRedoStack` when a user executes a new command:

image::UndoRedoActivityDiagram.png[width="650"]
    Figure 18: Undo Redo Activity Diagram

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: Implementation of `UndoableCommand`

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Add a new abstract method `executeUndoableCommand()`
** Pros: We will not lose any undone/redone functionality as it is now part of the default behaviour. Classes that deal with `Command` do not have to know that `executeUndoableCommand()` exist.
** Cons: Hard for new developers to understand the template pattern.
* **Alternative 2:** Just override `execute()`
** Pros: Does not involve the template pattern, easier for new developers to understand.
** Cons: Classes that inherit from `UndoableCommand` must remember to call `super.execute()`, or lose the ability to undo/redo.

===== Aspect: How undo & redo executes

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Saves the entire address book.
** Pros: Easy to implement.
** Cons: May have performance issues in terms of memory usage.
* **Alternative 2:** Individual command knows how to undo/redo by itself.
** Pros: Will use less memory (e.g. for `delete`, just save the person being deleted).
** Cons: We must ensure that the implementation of each individual command are correct.


===== Aspect: Type of commands that can be undone/redone

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Only include commands that modifies TeachConnect (`add`, `clear`, `edit`).
** Pros: We only revert changes that are hard to change back (the view can easily be re-modified as no data are * lost).
** Cons: User might think that undo also applies when the list is modified (undoing filtering for example), * only to realize that it does not do that, after executing `undo`.
* **Alternative 2:** Include all commands.
** Pros: Might be more intuitive for the user.
** Cons: User have no way of skipping such commands if he or she just want to reset the state of the address * book and not the view.
**Additional Info:** See our discussion  https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level4/issues/390#issuecomment-298936672[here].


===== Aspect: Data structure to support the undo/redo commands

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Use separate stack for undo and redo
** Pros: Easy to understand for new Computer Science student undergraduates to understand, who are likely to be * the new incoming developers of our project.
** Cons: Logic is duplicated twice. For example, when a new command is executed, we must remember to update * both `HistoryManager` and `UndoRedoStack`.
* **Alternative 2:** Use `HistoryManager` for undo/redo
** Pros: We do not need to maintain a separate stack, and just reuse what is already in the codebase.
** Cons: Requires dealing with commands that have already been undone: We must remember to skip these commands. Violates Single Responsibility Principle and Separation of Concerns as `HistoryManager` now needs to do two * different things.
// end::undoredo[]

// tag::import[]
=== Import Contacts
==== Current Implementation
The ImportCommand uses `XmlAddressBookStorage` to generate a temporary `AddressBook` object from a given path. It takes in a String value path. The command then adds the contacts or the classes found in the temporary `AddressBook` object into the model. Below is the rough idea of the constructor for the class:
[source,java]
public ImportCommand(String importPath) {
        requireNonNull(importPath);
        this.filePath = importPath;
        addressBookStorage = new XmlAddressBookStorage(filePath);
}

image::ImportCommandFlowChart.png[align="center"]
    Figure 19: Import command flow chart

Import command extends `Undoable Command` and hence Undo can be called on it. It also initially checks if the given file path is valid and if so initialises the contacts from there, creates a `Person` object and adds it to the current `TeachConnect` with the help of `model`.For importing classes `Class` objects are first created and `students` related to the classes are stored before being added to the model. The code can be found below.
[source, java]
----
public CommandResult executeUndoableCommand() throws CommandException {
     peopleToBeImported(people);
     studentToBeImported(students);
     classesToBeImported(students, classes);

     return new CommandResult(MESSAGE_SUCCESS);
}
----

==== Design Considerations
===== Aspects : Implementation Import Command

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Only import from an `XML` file.
** Pros: Goes well with the idea of TeachConnect. Easier to implement and also clear distinction of the file that needs to be imported by the user with the help of the .XML extension.
** Cons: User might want to import from Excel only to realise this isn't possible.
* **Alternative 2:** Include import from an `Excel` file too.
** Pros: Might be more intuitive for the user and might come in handy.
** Cons: Will not really help the user distinguish the exact file to be imported. Care has to be taken so that the input by the user follows a certain format to parse the content properly.
// end::import[]

// tag::export[]
=== Export Contacts
==== Current Implementation

The `ExportCommand` uses `XmlAddressBookStorage` class to generate a xml file based on a given range/index/tag and save it to the location specified with the chosen file name. It takes in String `name` String `range` Tag `tag` String `path` String `type`.It is also possible to export classes with String `path` String `name` String `type` as parameters. The tag is not compulsory and can be excluded or included depending on the user. Below is the basic idea of the constructor for the class:

[source,java]
----
ExportCommand(String range, Tag tag, String path, String nameOfExportFile, String type) {
        this.range = range;
        this.path = path;
        thispublic.tag = tag;
        this.nameOfExportFile = nameOfExportFile;
        this.type = type;

        teachConnectBook = new AddressBook();
}
----

image::ExportCommandDiagram.png[align="center"]
    Figure 20: Export command flow chart

The method `handleRange()` splits the range using a separator "," and returns a `String` array with the upper bound and lower bound as values. In some cases it also returns the String `all` or the single integer `index` that has to be exported. Based on the type it also exports to an excel format (CSV file) or XML format (XML file).

Below is an extract of the method `handleRange()`:

[source,java]
----
public String[] handleRange() throws IOException {
        String[] rangeStringArray = this.range.split(",");
        if (rangeStringArray.length > 2) {
            throw new IOException();
        }
        return rangeStringArray;
}
----

Choosing to export classes follows a different pattern. It exports all the classes and the students related to those classes.

Any range with more than 2 values in the String array returns an IO Exception. There are 4 individual cases when exporting contacts and multiple combinations of these:

* All (Without a tag)
** if the word `all` is present in the user input, we will just export all the contacts from the last shown list.
* All (With a Tag)
** if the word `all` is present along with a tag specified in the user input, we will just export all the contacts with that particular tag from the last shown list
* Specific index (e.g. 1, 2, 3)
** if the user input contains a specific index, we will add that index (one-based) to the `teachConnectBook`.
* Range of indexes (e.g. 1,5)
** if the user input contains a range which is identified by the `,` character, we will add that range of index (one-based) to the `teachConnectBook` including the lower range but excluding the upper bound.
* Range of indexes (with a tag)
** if the user input contains a range which is identified by the `,` character along with the tag, we will add that range of index (one-based) to the `teachConnectBook` if that contact contains that particular tag including the lower range but excluding the upper bound.

The final step is to create the xml/excel file from the `teachConnectBook`. This is done with the help of the method `tryStorage()`.

Depending on the type of export it can also be exported to an excel format with the help of Arraylists called `exportAdditionPeople`, `exportAdditionClasses`, `exportAdditionStudents`.


==== Design Considerations
===== Aspects : Implementation Export Command
* **Alternative 1:** Only export to an `XML` file.
** Pros: Easier implementation and very helpful for the import command as import can only be done from an XML file.
** Cons: The exported file might not be very user friendly to read in the xml file format and hence later referencing to the file after exporting can be a nightmare.
* **Alternative 2 (current choice):** Include export to an `Excel` file too.
** Pros: Might be more intuitive for the user and might come in handy especially when the user wants to print it later or read the contents in a user friendly format.
** Cons: Complex implementation there by giving rise to more boundary cases to consider.

// end::export[]

// tag::shortcut[]
=== Personalised Shortcut
==== Current Implementation

The personalised shortcut uses a `ShortcutDouble` to hold the shortcut word and the command word. There is a `UniqueShortcutDoublesList` to which these `ShortcutDoubles` are added. The comparator in the `ShortcutDouble` accounts to check for any duplicates in the `UniqueShortcutDoublesList`. This list is then added to the `addressbook.xml` so as to load the shortcuts on initialisation. Below is a short code snippet of the constructor of the ShortcutDouble:

[source,java]
----
public ShortcutDoubles(String shortcutWord, String commandWord) {
        this.shortcutWord = shortcutWord;
        this.commandWord = commandWord;
}
----

This ShortcutDouble is called using the `ShortcutCommand`. Below is the constructor to the ShortcutCommand:
[source,java]
----
public ShortcutCommand(String commandWord, String shortcutWord) {
        this.shortcutWord = shortcutWord;
        this.commandWord = commandWord;
}
----

Shortcut command extends `UndoableCommand` and hence is undoable. It initially calls a filtered commandsList to which a new `ShortcutDouble` is added if it passes all validity checks.

There is a check to find if the command is already present and the method used for this is called `checkIfCommandPresent()`.By default it returns false.

You can also choose to list all the shortcuts created until now. This displays the `UniqueShortcutDoublesList` instead of the contacts in the list panel. A high level sequence diagram is given below :

image::ListShortcutsHighLevelSequenceDiagrams.png[width="600"]
    Figure 21: List Shortcut High Level Sequence Diagram


As of now the conditions to take note of are:
* Shortcut can be only one word.
* The command word should already exist.
* New commands are to be added in the `commandsPresent` String array of `ShortcutCommand` class.

==== Design Considerations
===== Aspects : Implementation Shortcut Command
* **Alternative 1:** Restricting the number of aliases of a command word.
** Pros: Allows for setting up a shortcut word there by increasing the usability of the app.
** Cons: Wouldn't help much if the user keeps forgetting the shortcut word too because if there is only one shortcut alias and the user might forget it.
* **Alternative 2 (current choice):** Allowing multiple number of shortcut words for a single command word
** Pros: User can create multiple aliases there by giving the user more personalisation and the flexibility of forgetting the words as he can create more of them.
** Cons: Need to consider several cases for duplicate shortcuts and maintain a dynamic list without forgetting the shortcuts when the app is closed without hardcoding the shortcut word into each command.
// end::shortcut[]

// tag::deleteshortcut[]
=== Deleting Personalised Shortcut
==== Current Implementation

The ShortcutDouble can be deleted using the `DeleteShortcutCommand`. The sequence diagram is below :

image::DeleteShortcutSequenceDiagram.png[width="600"]
    Figure 22: Delete Shortcut Sequence Diagram

The `ShortcutDouble` is deleted from the `UniqueShortcutDoublesList`. It throws a `CommandShortcutNotFoundException` in case the shortcut is not found. Below is the constructor to the DeleteShortcutCommand:
[source,java]
----
public DeleteShortcutCommand(String commandWord, String shortcutWord) {
        this.commandWord = commandWord;
        this.shortcutWord = shortcutWord;
        commandShortcut = new ShortcutDoubles(shortcutWord, commandWord);
}
----

DeleteShortcut command extends `UndoableCommand` and hence is undoable. It calls the method `deleteCommandShortcut()` in the model class to achieve its objective.

As of now the conditions to take note of are:
* DeleteShortcut can only delete a shortcut if the command is already present and the shortcut has been made previously.

==== Design Considerations
===== Aspects : Validity of the Delete Shortcut Command
* **Alternative 1:** Omit the delete shortcut command.
** Pros: Would require less implementation considering the fact that the shortcut has been added by the user.
** Cons: Would not give the user any room for mistake or change of mind as once added it would be not possible to delete it.
* **Alternative 2 (current choice):** Include the delete shortcut command.
** Pros: Will give the user the room to make mistake and change the shortcuts if needed. Would also help him in clearing the clutter of shortcuts which would have developed over time.
** Cons: Will have to take care of various edge cases when the shortcuts are not present and keep modifying the dynamic list. Several relevant exceptions have to be thrown and taken care of.
// end::deleteshortcut[]

// tag::studentmanagement[]
=== [Incomplete] Student Management
==== Current Implementation

The student manangement allows the user of TeachConnect to manage a particular type of contact, a student. The user is capable of interacting with the student contact just like with any other contact, for example: adding, editing, deleting and so on. In addition, users will be able to form classes to group students of the same class together. An overview of the Model Class after implementation is shown below:

image::EditedModelClassDiagram.png[align="center"]
    Figure 23: Model Class after implementation of Student

As shown above, `student` extends from `person`, giving `student` access to its constructor and getter methods for `name`, `phone`, `email`, `address` whereas only `student` will have access to `class`.

==== Design Considerations
===== Aspects : Implementation of student

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** student extends person
** Pros: Allow students access to person methods while restricting person from accessing student methods.
** Cons: A separate UniqueStudentList is required to store the student contacts.
* **Alternative 2:** only use a tag to show its a student
** Pros: Simpler to implement and tags are visible to user
** Cons: Requires every operation to check the tags. Tags can be removed.
// end::studentmanagement[]

// tag::eventmanagement[]

=== Schedule Management
==== Current Implementation
There are two types of schedule: an `Appointment` or a `Task`. The model diagrams for `Appointment` and `Task` are shown in `Figure 24` and `Figure 25`.

image::AppointmentModelClassDiagram.png[align="center"]
    Figure 24: Appointment Class Diagram

image::TaskModelClassDiagram.png[align="center"]
    Figure 25: Task Class Diagram

`Appointment` has 4 variables:

* Title: Holds description for the appointment.
* Start Time: Holds the starting time of the appointment.
* End time: Holds the end time of the appointment.
* Person to meet: (optional) Holds the target in the appointment.

`Task` has 2 variables:

* Title: Holds description for the task.
* Time: Holds the time the task is expected to be finished.

Similar to `UniquePersonList` and `UniqueTagList`, `UniqueAppointmentList` and `UniqueTaskList` is linked to `AddressBook`. Request to change to the `AddressBook` model is signalled through `ModelManager`.

Every `Appointment` in the `UniqueAppointmentList` is also added to `CalendarFX` 's Calendar entry list to be rendered on the Calendar View in the GUI. When there is a change in the `UniqueAppointmentList`, an `AppointmentListChangedEvent` will be propagated through the `EventsCenter`. When it reaches the `UI` component, the result is re-syncing of `UniqueAppointmentList` and `CalendarFx` 's Calendar entry list and the Calendar View in the GUI will be updated. The code below shows how the re-syncing works within the `UI` component.
[source,java]
----
private void handleAppointmentListChangedEvent(AppointmentListChangedEvent event) {
        appointmentList = event.appointmentList;
        Platform.runLater(
                this::updateCalendar
        );
}
private void updateCalendar() {
        calendar.clear();
        ArrayList<Entry> entries = getEntries();
        for (Entry entry : entries) {
                calendar.addEntry(entry);
        }
}
----

==== Design Considerations
===== Aspects : Implementation of set appointment/task
* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Users can set appointment/task with already elapsed starting time/deadline.
** Pros: With this implementation, TeachConnect can help the user keep track of past schedules which weren't added to the schedule list.
** Cons: This is not the most intuitive implementation and the application could accept error-prone date input from the user side.
* **Alternative 2:** Users can only set  appointment/task with the starting time/deadline in the future.
** Pros: This is the more intuitive approach and it can prevent the user from keying in "redundant" schedule.
** Cons: As TeachConnect fetches the current time from the user's system, if the user for some purposes sets the system's time to deviate from the world clock, some difficulties may arise when he/she wants to add new event.

// end::eventmanagement[]

// tag::theme[]

=== Changing GUI theme
==== Current Implementation
The current implementation of this command only involves `Logic`, `EventsCenter` and `UI` components of the application.

To illustrate how the change theme command works, `Figure 26` shows the sequence diagram for changing the theme to `dark` theme.

image::ChangeThemeSequenceDiagram.png[align="center"]
    Figure 26: Change Theme Command Sequence Diagram


==== Design Considerations
===== Aspects : Saving of user selected theme to `UserPrefs` or `Storage`

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Theme selected is not saved to storage or `UserPrefs`, thus when TeachConnect starts the default theme is always selected.
** Pros: This implementation is more simple and we don't need to interact with `Model`.
** Cons: If the users want to use a theme other than the default one, it will be very inconvenient for them as they will have to change the theme every time they start up TeachConnect.
* **Alternative 2:** Last selected theme by the users would be saved to storage or `UserPrefs`.
** Pros: Users experience can be enhanced as users can have the theme they like selected automatically each time they start up TeachConnect.
** Cons: The command implementation would be more complex as we need to interact with `Model` and `Storage` components too.

// end::theme[]
// tag::sort[]

=== Sorting Contacts
==== Current Implementation
This command sorts all the contacts in TeachConnect lexicographically.
The command calls upon a `sortByNameFilteredPersonList()` method in `Model`, which then calls upon the `sortList()` method in `UniqueContactList`. The `sortList()` method sorts the entire contact list using a comparator.
Below is the code snippet.

 public void sortList() {
        Comparator<Person> sortByName = new Comparator<Person>() {
            @Override
            public int compare (Person contact1, Person contact2)  {
                return contact1.getName().fullName.compareToIgnoreCase(contact2.getName().fullName);
            }
        };
        FXCollections.sort(combinedList, sortByName);
    }

==== Design Considerations
===== Aspects : Automatic sorting of contacts, implementation of sort contacts.

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** TeachConnect will only sort contacts after user keys in the command.
** Pros: This implementation is simpler and more intuitive.
** Cons: Users might find a slight hassle to have to key in the sort command every time a new contact is added.
* **Alternative 2: ** TeachConnect supports an automatic sorting of contacts.
** Pros: When new contacts are added, they are automatic sorted without the need to key in the command.
** Cons: The command implementation might be more complex and it would make the command redundant. Users also might not always want their contact list to be sorted.

// end::sort[]

// tag::encryption/decryption[]

=== Encryption/Decryption [Proposed]
==== Proposed Implementation
TeachConnect will also have a data encryption feature to keep the teacher's sensitive contact data safe from unauthorised persons.
To illustrate how the encrypt command works, `Figure 27` shows the sequence diagram when the command `encrypt pw/<password>` is entered.


image::EncryptionSequenceDiagram.png[align="center"]
Figure 27: Encrypt Command Sequence Diagram

The Decrypt command also follows the same flow, except that `DecryptEvent` is posted,`handleDecryptEvent` is called instead, and decryptUtil handles the decryption.

After encryption the result would be an encrypted `addressBook.xml` file, and after decryption the result is a decrypted and human-readable `addressBook.xml` file.


==== Design Considerations
===== Aspects : Location to save password

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Users remember their own passwords.
** Pros: The password is also not stored locally within TeachConnect, hence it would be impossible to obtain the password from the application. No one else would have the password but the user, provided that he/she does not share it with any unauthorised persons.
** Cons: If the user forgets the password, then the file cannot be decrypted. Also, the user needs to find secure means to share this password with other authorised persons.
* **Alternative 2: ** Password is saved within TeachConnect.
** Pros: Users will find it more convenient as they do not have to remember their password.
** Cons: The command implementation might be more complex. There is a risk of unauthorised persons breaking and reverse-engineering the password.

// end::encryption/decryption[]


=== Logging

We are using `java.util.logging` package for logging. The `LogsCenter` class is used to manage the logging levels and logging destinations.

* The logging level can be controlled using the `logLevel` setting in the configuration file (See <<Implementation-Configuration>>)
* The `Logger` for a class can be obtained using `LogsCenter.getLogger(Class)` which will log messages according to the specified logging level
* Currently log messages are output through: `Console` and to a `.log` file.

*Logging Levels*

* `SEVERE` : Critical problem detected which may possibly cause the termination of the application
* `WARNING` : Can continue, but with caution
* `INFO` : Information showing the noteworthy actions by the App
* `FINE` : Details that is not usually noteworthy but may be useful in debugging e.g. print the actual list instead of just its size

[[Implementation-Configuration]]

=== Configuration

Certain properties of the application can be controlled (e.g App name, logging level) through the configuration file (default: `config.json`).

== Documentation

We use asciidoc for writing documentation.

[NOTE]
We chose asciidoc over Markdown because asciidoc, although a bit more complex than Markdown, provides more flexibility in formatting.

=== Editing Documentation

See <<UsingGradle#rendering-asciidoc-files, UsingGradle.adoc>> to learn how to render `.adoc` files locally to preview the end result of your edits.
Alternatively, you can download the AsciiDoc plugin for IntelliJ, which allows you to preview the changes you have made to your `.adoc` files in real-time.

=== Publishing Documentation

See <<UsingTravis#deploying-github-pages, UsingTravis.adoc>> to learn how to deploy GitHub Pages using Travis.

=== Converting Documentation to PDF format

We use https://www.google.com/chrome/browser/desktop/[Google Chrome] for converting documentation to PDF format, as Chrome's PDF engine preserves hyperlinks used in webpages.

Here are the steps to convert the project documentation files to PDF format.

.  Follow the instructions in <<UsingGradle#rendering-asciidoc-files, UsingGradle.adoc>> to convert the AsciiDoc files in the `docs/` directory to HTML format.
.  Go to your generated HTML files in the `build/docs` folder, right click on them and select `Open with` -> `Google Chrome`.
.  Within Chrome, click on the `Print` option in Chrome's menu.
.  Set the destination to `Save as PDF`, then click `Save` to save a copy of the file in PDF format. For best results, use the settings indicated in `Figure 27` below.

[[Testing]]
== Testing

=== Running Tests

There are three ways to run tests.

[TIP]
The most reliable way to run tests is the 3rd one. The first two methods might fail some GUI tests due to platform/resolution-specific idiosyncrasies.

*Method 1: Using IntelliJ JUnit test runner*

* To run all tests, right-click on the `src/test/java` folder and choose `Run 'All Tests'`
* To run a subset of tests, you can right-click on a test package, test class, or a test and choose `Run 'ABC'`

*Method 2: Using Gradle*

* Open a console and run the command `gradlew clean allTests` (Mac/Linux: `./gradlew clean allTests`)

[NOTE]
See <<UsingGradle#, UsingGradle.adoc>> for more info on how to run tests using Gradle.

*Method 3: Using Gradle (headless)*

Thanks to the https://github.com/TestFX/TestFX[TestFX] library we use, our GUI tests can be run in the _headless_ mode. In the headless mode, GUI tests do not show up on the screen. That means the developer can do other things on the Computer while the tests are running.

To run tests in headless mode, open a console and run the command `gradlew clean headless allTests` (Mac/Linux: `./gradlew clean headless allTests`)

=== Types of tests

We have two types of tests:

.  *GUI Tests* - These are tests involving the GUI. They include,
.. _System Tests_ that test the entire App by simulating user actions on the GUI. These are in the `systemtests` package.
.. _Unit tests_ that test the individual components. These are in `seedu.address.ui` package.
.  *Non-GUI Tests* - These are tests not involving the GUI. They include,
..  _Unit tests_ targeting the lowest level methods/classes. +
e.g. `seedu.address.commons.StringUtilTest`
..  _Integration tests_ that are checking the integration of multiple code units (those code units are assumed to be working). +
e.g. `seedu.address.storage.StorageManagerTest`
..  Hybrids of unit and integration tests. These test are checking multiple code units as well as how the are connected together. +
e.g. `seedu.address.logic.LogicManagerTest`


=== Troubleshooting Testing
**Problem: `HelpWindowTest` fails with a `NullPointerException`.**

* Reason: One of its dependencies, `UserGuide.html` in `src/main/resources/docs` is missing.
* Solution: Execute Gradle task `processResources`.

== Dev Ops

=== Build Automation

See <<UsingGradle#, UsingGradle.adoc>> to learn how to use Gradle for build automation.

=== Continuous Integration

We use https://travis-ci.org/[Travis CI] and https://www.appveyor.com/[AppVeyor] to perform _Continuous Integration_ on our projects. See <<UsingTravis#, UsingTravis.adoc>> and <<UsingAppVeyor#, UsingAppVeyor.adoc>> for more details.

=== Coverage Reporting

We use https://coveralls.io/[Coveralls] to track the code coverage of our projects. See <<UsingCoveralls#, UsingCoveralls.adoc>> for more details.

=== Documentation Previews
When a pull request has changes to asciidoc files, you can use https://www.netlify.com/[Netlify] to see a preview of how the HTML version of those asciidoc files will look like when the pull request is merged. See <<UsingNetlify#, UsingNetlify.adoc>> for more details.

=== Making a Release

Here are the steps to create a new release.

.  Update the version number in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java[`MainApp.java`].
.  Generate a JAR file <<UsingGradle#creating-the-jar-file, using Gradle>>.
.  Tag the repo with the version number. e.g. `v0.1`
.  https://help.github.com/articles/creating-releases/[Create a new release using GitHub] and upload the JAR file you created.

=== Managing Dependencies

A project often depends on third-party libraries. For example, TeachConnect depends on the http://wiki.fasterxml.com/JacksonHome[Jackson library] for XML parsing. Managing these _dependencies_ can be automated using Gradle. For example, Gradle can download the dependencies automatically, which is better than these alternatives. +
a. Include those libraries in the repo (this bloats the repo size) +
b. Require developers to download those libraries manually (this creates extra work for developers)

== Suggested Programming Tasks to Get Started

Suggested path for new programmers:

1. First, add small local-impact (i.e. the impact of the change does not go beyond the component) enhancements to one component at a time. Some suggestions are given in <<GetStartedProgramming-EachComponent>>.

2. Next, add a feature that touches multiple components to learn how to implement an end-to-end feature across all components. <<GetStartedProgramming-RemarkCommand>> explains how to go about adding such a feature.

*Feature Contribution*

1. Mukesh Gadupudi

** Major Feature : Sharing of Contacts

*** Contacts can be imported or exported
*** They can be exported based on the tag or index
*** Import can be done given the file path of an XML file

** Minor Feature : Email contacts

*** Contacts can be emailed by either by tag or an individual contact.

** How the features fit into the product scope :

*** Major Feature: This feature can help teachers share contacts with other teachers. This is especially useful when teachers change classes or pass on the class to other teachers. Updating and losing data is also a common problem and to overcome this a backup can be stored by using this feature.

*** Minor Feature: This feature can help teachers email contacts. This might be really helpful when the teacher wants to remind parents with appointments or remind students with the work they need to finish. This also helps the teachers send group messages to class or parents regarding some important announcements.

2. Rachel Ngo Phuong Thao
** Major Feature : Managing Appointments & Tasks

*** Users can add and remove appointments & tasks in TeachConnect.
*** The appointments would be rendered in a calendar in the GUI.
** Minor Feature : Changing the GUI theme

*** Users can set the theme of the GUI to `dark`, `light` or `galaxy` theme.

** How the features fit into the product scope :

*** Major Feature: This feature can help teachers keeping track of any upcoming appointment or task they have. This can be useful for teachers or teaching associates who frequently need to meet up with students and parents for counselling or administrative purposes.

*** Minor Feature: This feature increases the aesthetic sense and helps people set the theme according to their taste.

3. Jonathan

** Major Feature : Data Encryption
*** Encrypts the data for increased safety

** Minor Feature : Sort Contacts

*** Contacts can be sorted in alphabetical order of the name/tag or the phone number of the contacts.

** How the features fit into the product scope :

*** Major Feature: Since TeachConnect has a lot of personal details of students and parents, the owner of the address book would want to encrypt the application data file to prevent outside access to sensitive information.

*** Minor Feature: This helps teacher relate and understand the index of the contacts in the TeachConnect better. Indexing becomes easy when they later want to export or set appointments.

4. Randy Pang Pang

** Major Feature : Management of student contacts
*** Student contact can be created and be added into classes

** Minor Feature : Multiple tabs for the list in GUI
*** The list in GUI will hava tabs for multiple different lists

** How the features fit into the product scope :

*** Major Feature: This feature is essential to TeachConnect as it helps teachers to remember which class did they taught a particular student.

*** Minor Feature: This feature allows the teacher to keep multiple list, eg. one for students and one for all contacts. It also allows them to switch between multiple lists without having to type another list command.
